# üìù Bolt Example Field Extension

This extension allows you to use fields of `type: example-field` in your 
ContentTypes, as defined in `contenttypes.yaml`

```bash
composer require bobdenotter/example-field 
```

It's not particularly useful in and of itself, but it can be used as a 
boilerplate to build your own Field type extensions on.

The part below is only for _developing_ the extension. Not required for general
usage of the extension in your Bolt Project
